To sucessfully install the Inventor CAD program on your own machines a few requirements must be met:

1. SOFTWARE: 

Be mindful that Inventor is a large package to download (approx. 10-15GB), please try the installation at home become coming to a session.

Autodesk provides academics (includes students) with a 3-year license of its software for free (educational use only). In order to get your free license, please register an account at (http://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/inventor-professional) after you have registered your account you can download Autodesk Inventor through the above link. 

Please contact us if you are having difficulties in installing the software.

2. HARDWARE: 

It is advised that you have a reasonably powered WINDOWS laptop for the event. The minimum and recommended machine specifications can be found here (https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/inventor-products/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/System-requirements-for-Autodesk-Inventor-Products.html) 

For MAC users: You can install Autodesk Inventor on a Mac computer however it will need to be on a Windows partition. The system can use Apple Boot Camp to manage a dual OS configuration and meet the minimum system requirements. Autodesk Inventor Professional can also be used on the Mac via Parallels Desktop for Mac without having a boot directly into the Windows OS, so it is easy to switch between platforms. 

Additionally, a three-buttoned mouse (with a mouse wheel) - we recommend bringing a standard three button mouse when using Autodesk Inventor. Though this is not compulsory, this will be the best tool when working with the graphical user interface. 

4. Learning Materials: All the learning materials plus additional practive examples can be downloaded here, although please do note that all files were created in the 2016 version of the software (the inventor program installed on the university computers are the 2014 version and will not support this format).
