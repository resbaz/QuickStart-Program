# QuickStart-Program
This repository contains all student learning materials for the CAD QuickStart program. 

For students wanting to learn computer-aided design please follow the installation instructions to download the Inventor program from the Autodesk website. Students can bring any questions to the mentors during the QuickStart sessions, however should have the software installed on their own machine. 

All files in this repositioy are created in the 2016 version of the program which will not be backwards compatible to the Inventor program currently installed on the university computers (2014 ver.)
